# README stuff

This repository is where I do some of my Blender experiments. In general they will all be scripting based and use the various Python interfaces to Blender.

## Notes

I have installed a few libraries into Blender:

```
$BLENDER_HOME/4.4/bin/python3.11 -m pip install healpy sympy scipy
```
